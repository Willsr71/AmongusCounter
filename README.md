# Amongus Counter
This project is nothing short of an abomination. It is designed to search as quickly as possible for amongus. Technically you can use it for any 2 part pattern though if you really want.

# Usage
```
amonguscounter.jar [--patterns <folder>] [--image <input image file>] [--outputImage <output image file>] [--allowedErrors <number>]
```
You will need to copy the patterns folder to wherever you are running your jar, I haven't bothered doing that automatically yet.

There is also pretty much no error handling, good luck.


### Defaults
Patterns folder: `patterns`  
Input image: `place.png`  
Output image: `output.png`  
Allowed errors: `1`
